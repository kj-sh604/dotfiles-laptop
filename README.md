(***for my laptops***) personal collection of config files for my Linux set-up. I mostly use a cringe-looking awesome window manager "rice":

**dotfiles are updated nightly**



#### note:

i am no longer updating the "t450" and "Macbook5,5" branches of this repo since I do not have these devices anymore. However, I will not be deleting said branches from the repo, for archival purposes ðŸ˜Œ
